# SRM
This repository contains the structural response model (SRM) code for the Seismo-Geodetic Ice Penetrator (SGIP) shock isolation design study.

The Ansys impact simulation results, used as inputs to the SRM, are placed in the "Input Data" folder. 

Before running the structural response model, process the impact simulation data using dataPrep.m. This file will create two data files: PreppedData.mat and ImpactDurations.mat.

Run the shock isolation design study using the DesignStudy.m script.
